### Concerns for this inning

  * Do either of us have anything that we should be aware of? (upcoming life events, concerns about the upcoming curriculum, job hunt, etc)

    * Upcoming life events:

    * Concerns about upcoming curriculum:

        * working with larger group: github skills & git for pairs & social skills & technical skills & imposter syndrome

        * instructor feedback & tracking instructor feedback

        * nervous about project check-ins with instructors

        * Instructors comments from last mod.

    * Etc:

### Mentee identifies and shares with mentor:

  * What do I need when I get overwhelmed?

    * If you notice I seem overwhelmed, my head down, or I seem wandering please suggest I do one of these things as I might not remember.
      * skull ice pack
      * 5 min cold shower break
      * brushing teeth
      * 5 min grounding noticing/breath meditation break
      * 10 min break to go get Mocha Frappecinno from Starbucks

  * Who are my other supports and resources for this inning?
      * pre-scheduled/scheduling with Madeleine Halle
      * possibly instructors. I have marked teacher time on the calendar but have previously been told they don't have the bandwidth to help me
      * maybe a rock but I got ghosted last time before we even met

      * I will need to look for more help once we get our schedule down and Madeleines.
      * Madeleine cannot help with projects at all. Unless not graded.
